## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

### Welcome you to my ~~gayhub~~ github.

### Nice to see you, friends! ğŸ˜„

### Iâ€™m currently in college now and learning for Android (I hadn't been exposed to before ğŸ˜¥).

## However, I have mastered Python, Pascal, C++, C.

## Especially, I'm studing Bilibili API for ... err .. for fun? I don't know very much.ğŸ˜‹

ğŸ˜«ğŸ˜«ğŸ˜« I think it is hard for me to write a profile. Maybe later?? I think there is no one mention me. ğŸ˜“
